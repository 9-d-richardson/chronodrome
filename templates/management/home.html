<h1>Welcome to ChronoDrome</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Make timelines!</li>
	<li>Track your progress!</li>
</ul>
<p>ChronoDrome is a simple website with one purpose: creating and sharing timelines and 
	reading orders. It's meant to be both simple and flexible, which you'll 
	hopefully see when you start making timelines of your own.
<p>What sort of stuff qualifies? Well, pretty much anything that should be read
	or viewed or consumed in a particular order, whether it's your favorite shows
	or your favorite series of books.
<p>Have feedback, requests, or bug reports? Send them <a href="{% url 'feedback' %}">here</a>!</p>
